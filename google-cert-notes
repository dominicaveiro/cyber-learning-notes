## 🛡️ Key Concepts

> **Threat Actor** – A person or group who poses a security risk.

Cybersecurity exists to protect organisations from **external and internal threats**, meet **regulatory compliance**, maintain/improve **productivity**, reduce **costs**, and safeguard **brand trust**.

---

## 🧑‍💼 Common Job Titles
- Security Analyst / Specialist  
- Cybersecurity Analyst / Specialist  
- SOC (Security Operations Centre) Analyst  
- Information Security Analyst  

---

## 🎯 Analyst Responsibilities
- Protect computers and networks  
- Run exercises to find weaknesses  
- Install protection software  
- Conduct security audits  
- Work with operations teams

> **Engineers build detections. Analysts operate and respond.**  
> **Playbook** = Step-by-step response to a specific detection or alert.

## 📘 Security Principles

- **Compliance** – Adhering to internal standards & external regulations to avoid fines and breaches.  
- **Security Frameworks** – Guidelines to help plan defences and mitigate risk.  
- **Security Controls** – Safeguards used with frameworks to reduce risks.  
- **Security Posture** – An organisation’s ability to defend against threats and adapt to changes.

---

## 👥 Threat Types

- **Internal Threats** – Current/former staff, vendors, or partners (accidental or intentional)  
- **External Threats** – Malicious actors outside the organisation  
- Example: An employee who clicks a malicious email link = accidental internal threat

---

## 🌐 Security Domains

- **Network Security** – Protecting infrastructure, services, and data from unauthorised access  
- **Cloud Security** – Securing cloud-based assets, ensuring correct config and access control  
- **Programming in Cyber** – Used to automate tasks, analyse web traffic, and detect anomalies  

---

## 💼 Transferable Skills (soft skills)
- Communication  
- Collaboration  
- Analytical thinking  
- Problem-solving  

## 🛠️ Technical Skills
- Programming (Python, Bash, etc.)  
- Using SIEM tools  
- Basic computer forensics

# History of Cybersecurity  
**Google Cybersecurity Certificate – Course 1, Module 2**

---

## 🧠 Definitions

- **Computer virus** – Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations.  
- **Malware** – Software designed to damage software, devices, or networks.  
- **Phishing** – Use of digital communications to trick people into revealing data or installing malware.

---

## 🕰️ Key Cybersecurity Events

| Year | Event | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1986 | **Brain virus** (by Alvi brothers) | Infected inserted floppy disks, altered computing/security industry |
| 1988 | **Morris Worm** | Tried to assess internet size, but infected ~6,000 computers (~10%) |
| 2000 | **ILOVEYOU / Love Letter virus** | 45 million infected – first major social engineering attack |
| 2017 | **Equifax breach** | 143+ million personal records compromised |

## 🧑‍💻 Common Attack Methods

### 🔐 Phishing Types
- **BEC** – Impersonate trusted source to gain financial advantage  
- **Spear phishing** – Targeted phishing against specific individuals/groups  
- **Whaling** – Targeting high-level execs  
- **Vishing** – Voice phishing  
- **Smishing** – SMS/text-based phishing  

### 🦠 Malware Types
- **Virus** – Requires user action to execute  
- **Worm** – Self-replicating, no user action needed  
- **Ransomware** – Encrypts data, demands payment  
- **Spyware** – Gathers data without consent  

### 🧠 Social Engineering
- **Social media phishing** – Collect data from social platforms  
- **Watering hole attack** – Compromise a popular site  
- **USB baiting** – Drop malicious USB sticks  
- **Physical impersonation** – Enter buildings by posing as staff/vendor  

### ⚠️ Principles That Make Social Engineering Effective
- Authority  
- Intimidation  
- Social proof (consensus)  
- Scarcity  
- Familiarity  
- Trust  
- Urgency
